A website I made for the [Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/associations)

EXERCISE DESCRIPTION: "You want to build a site similar to a private Eventbrite which allows users to create events and then manage user signups. Users can create events and send invitations and parties (sound familiar?). Events take place at a specific date and at a location (which you can just store as a string, like "Andy's House").

A user can create events. A user can attend many events. An event can be attended by many users. An event creator can kick a person and many more!"
